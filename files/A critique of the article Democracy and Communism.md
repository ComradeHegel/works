> The bourgeoisie are the non-producers and owners of society while the proletarians are the producers of society.

This characterization is incorrect. What is society? The whole of the base and the superstructure. The contradiction between the material conditions of the mode of production and the ideological superstructure which springs forth from this is what constitutes society.  
The proletariat is a class, and a "member" of the economic base. The labor of the proletariat sustains a ruling-class, but does not "produce" society. Society is produced by the contradiction between the economic base and the superstructure.  
What can be correctly said is as follows: The bourgeoisie are the owners of the means of production, and the proletariat are the users of the means of production. The bourgeoisie direct the production process through this monopoly.  
What is differet about this conception? It follows the scientific analysis of class.

> It is the bourgeoisie which exploits value and accumulates it.

The bourgeoisie do not "exploit" value. Value is a conjunction of exchange-value and use-value, it cannot be exploited. Value can be increased by a certain quantity of "human labor in the abstract." Within the general formula for capital, workers labor for a certain amount of time, and get paid in proportion to the cost of maintaining their labor-power. Marx writes:  
  "We started with the supposition that labour-power is bought and sold at its value. Its value, like that of all other   commodities, is determined by the working-time necessary to its production. If the production of the average daily means of   subsistence of the labourer takes up 6 hours, he must work, on the average, 6 hours every day, to produce his daily labour- power, or to reproduce the value received as the result of its sale. The necessary part of his working-day amounts to 6 hours, and is, therefore, caeteris paribus [other things being equal], a given quantity."  
After the worker has labored the first part of the workday (where the value of constant and variable capital is met), the worker labors for extra time. This is when the extraction of surplus value occurs. The worker labors "for free", i.e. they are not producing for thier consumption but for their employer's profits. It is the surplus value of this surplus value which the caitalist accumulates.
