# A Critique of "Can Democracy and Communism co-exist? What do we mean by "democracy" and what is "Communism"?"

> A class is divided between the bourgeoisie (capitalists, owners of private property) and the proletarians (workers and peasants).

This is incorrect. Our society is divided into two classes, and strata of each class are constrained by the general class. The proletariat and bourgeoisie are not variants of the same; they are two different classes in contradiction with each other.

> The bourgeoisie are the non-producers and owners of society while the proletarians are the producers of society.

This characterization is incorrect. What is society? The whole of the base and the superstructure. The contradiction between the material conditions of the mode of production and the ideological superstructure which springs forth from this is what constitutes society.  
The proletariat is a class, and a "member" of the economic base. The labor of the proletariat sustains a ruling-class, but does not "produce" society. Society is produced by the contradiction between the economic base and the superstructure.  
What can be correctly said is as follows: The bourgeoisie are the owners of the means of production, and the proletariat are the users of the means of production. The bourgeoisie direct the production process through this monopoly.  
What is different about this conception? It follows the scientific analysis of class.

> It is the bourgeoisie which collect surplus value and accumulates it.

The bourgeoisie do not "collect" surplus value. Value is a conjunction of exchange-value and use-value, it cannot be exploited. Value can be increased by a certain quantity of "human labor in the abstract." Within the general formula for capital, workers labor for a certain amount of time, and get paid in proportion to the cost of maintaining their labor-power. Marx writes:  
  "We started with the supposition that labour-power is bought and sold at its value. Its value, like that of all other   commodities, is determined by the working-time necessary to its production. If the production of the average daily means of   subsistence of the labourer takes up 6 hours, he must work, on the average, 6 hours every day, to produce his daily labour- power, or to reproduce the value received as the result of its sale. The necessary part of his working-day amounts to 6 hours, and is, therefore, caeteris paribus [other things being equal], a given quantity."  
After the worker has labored the first part of the workday (where the value of constant and variable capital is met), the worker labors for extra time. This is when the extraction of surplus value occurs. The worker labors "for free", i.e. they are not producing for their consumption but for their employer's profits. It is the surplus value of this surplus value which the caitalist accumulates.  
It is evident that this exploitation is not more collection. It is not the case that the worker simply hands over some produce to the capitalist; it is the case that the worker itself is exploited. The surplus value is parted with not willingly but unwillingly. This forms the basis of the exploitative nature. of employment.

> Communism is the movement for the natural class struggle of the exploited class, the working class, which is the proletariat to move forward and own the means of production. The producers of society would have control over what they produce. Over their exploitation

I see no reason for such revisionism. Class struggle is the concept that there are two classes opposed to each other. Communism is the movement which "abolishes the present state of things" (The German Ideology), it is "the doctrine of the conditions of the liberation of the proletariat" (Principles of Communism). The crux of higher-stage communism is complete centralization of property as to abolish property altogether. It also presupposes a needs-based economy where production occurs for satisfaction and subsistence rather then for profit.

> Communism is the 'dictatorship' of the proletariat. Communism upholds the oppressed and oppresses the oppressors. It is a revolutionary ideal for the emancipation of humanity. According to Marx, first phase communism (Socialism) can be summed up in simple words- Abolition of private property.

Assuming the author is talking about "first-phase" communism, there is still incorrect material. Such a material is the comparison of communism to an ideal, which Marx explicitly warned against: "Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself."

> Communism establishes a Workers State which serves the working class ultimately. Since the state is an organ of class rule and a class society is still present during the revolutionary period to the transition of the final phase of communism, the communism that leads to a classless, stateless society- where humanity is truly a free creature we could say that  we require Socialism to emancipate to Communism for the very reason that class antagonisms need to be abolished to further succeed and world socialism must be achieved as attacks from capitalist encirclement will disrupt such process.

Assuming the communism used in interactions with the words "Workers' State" is lower-stage communism or socalism, the extension "which serves the working class ultimately" is redundant. Furthermore, socialism does not "establish" a revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat, rather that defines socialism. When it is stated that final-stage communism "leads to a classless, stateless society," the definition varies from what was defined above. To say that "we require Socialism to emancipate to Communism" is to be wrong. Socialism does not "emancipate to" communism, rather socialist society supposes a socialist base and socialist superstructure, which are necessary conditions for the transition to communism.

> Democracy is not just having a say in society but also having a contribution to what happens in society. 

Are these two things not the same?

> It is popular rule were people exercise authority in a way that it serves the people through the means of a state. Even if a state by it's nature is a parasitic model that oppresses in a class society this dispute can be settled throughout the concept we will be introducing very soon. Democracy in itself means a lot of things which can mean various things so we got the basic core definition. 

This section is incoherent, but it appears the author believes that democracy means a state. State is not government; democracy can exist without a state.

> As we know, Democracy is when people exercise authority and make up decisions and respond to decisions themselves. Referencing back to how a class society works and what Communism is we see that Communism is when the working class has control over the state using the state as an organ of class rule as it is. 

This is not the same definition of democracy as earlier. Assuming that the communism referred to here is lower-stage communism then this is not talking about democracy, but rather the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.

> The proletariat would own the means of production and factories will be managed by the working class itself.

We are still in socialism, however. The proletariat is not able to own everything, so co-ops will still exist alongside state or societal control.

> We see that the proletariat  are a big majority of class society. Organisation and division is lead by the working class themselves. For example factories are managed by Socialist-managers. They manage the means of production, receive a wage according to their contribution in their work, is an elected body by the workers of the factory and is able to be fired or expelled in such a manner.

This is one form of management, i.e. Soviet democracy. However, this does not relate to socialism or commuism being democratic.

> We see that Communism heavily applauds of democracy in the work place something which was not seen at all in capitalist society.

I fail to see how this has been proven.

> Communism's government is also made up of class conscious political sections of the proletariat of which the majority of society elects and influences. in Marxism workers form a vanguard that represents the workers  , many sections of the proletariat, overthrows the capitalist system and it's parasitic nature and upholds the true leadership of majority.

This is not democracy, rather this desctibes the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.

> Communism withers away class antagonisms and the class society will be withered once first phase communism is completed after global socialism. It is the democracy of the majority, the true difference between talking democracy of which capitalist countries have and practical democracy of which socialist countries have. 

What is the "democracy of the majority"? Nothing but empty words, a meaningless phrase. What is "talking democracy"? Most capitalist countries do have democracy, namely liberal democracy. What is "practical democracy"?

> We may think that capitalism (an economic system) upholds democratic political systems like 'liberalism'. What we need to realize here is that capitalist states in the first world tend to be democratic in the sense of it's word, with voting representatives every specific period yet the majority of society (the working class) does not have control over itself as it is being controlled by the bourgeoisie.

Capitalism is not, as stated here, "an economic system." Capitalism is a mode of production. Liberalism is not a political system. 
The majority of capitalist countries in the West are liberal democratic, which means horizontal accountability (checks and balances) and the free mandate (the official does not necessarily have to execute their campaign). Democracy does exist to some extent but it is flawed in that the influence the rich have is dramatically more than the influence the poor do.

> Capitalism itself is very undemocratic. It is that who controls private property exploits value and accumulates, it is that who does not produce get the profit and value. Getting payed is not the same as getting richer. Capitalists often give workers starvation wages especially in the third world and exploit large groups of people for the benefit of a single privileged minority, the rich - bourgeoisie.

This does not show capitalism is undemocratic in the sense of either of the two definitions posited.

> They do not give starvation wages for no reason, capitalism is a competitive economic system, if workers are given better wages companies will lack back to other capitalists and collapse. Competition produces winners and loosers. This is indeed why capitalism itself without a measure to control it like they do in the first world with a welfare state or introduce better conditions is very dictatorial, it's nature is already so. 

Again, this is simply a critique of the conditions of capitalism. This does not relate to whether it is democratic or not. Also, a welfare state or "better conditions" do not change the exploitative and alienating essence of capitalism.

> This is why capitalism needs to expand, it does not stay at home. It needs to invest and expand and exploit more and more industries. This is why corporations aim at the third world mostly due to loads of resources and cheap labor. 

Again, describing imperialism does not relate to whether capitalism has democracy.

> Democracy there is more of a reaction to the economic system. But even that is not really as effective as proletarian (working class) democracy. In capitalist society we have a democracy that is curtailed, wretched, false , a democracy only for the rich , for the minority. Capitalist states serve corporations before workers. Capitalist states serve profit before need. 

This argument is good, if only it were the primary topic of this section.

I have no personal reasons to attack this article: Galaxy is a comrade. However, this article does not present clear or concise or coherent arguments and contains very distorted information.
