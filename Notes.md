# Notes

1. Quotes from the German Ideology  
These are from Volume 1, Chapter 1.
2. A Treatise on Revolution  
Some of this I disagree with, and it's very much summary and speculation. I have worked on a much more in-depth "On Revolution" where I outline the revolution from the material conditions for it to arise all the way to communism.
3. Objects and Processes  
This work is Aristotelian idealism disguised with my pathetic attempt to reconcile it as materialism. The work is also unfinished.
4. Alternative forms of consciousness in revolution  
I found this work in the same document where I found "A Treatise on Revolution".
5. To Feudalism  
A slightly rushed exposition of historical materialism till fuedalism as outlined in The German Ideology.
6. On Revolution  
An in-depth outline of my thoughts on revolution, as well as certain concepts of Marxist theory.
7. A critique of the article Can Democracy and Communism Co-Exist  
A critical analysis of comrade Galaxy's (Galaxy#9968 on discord) article on communism and democracy.
