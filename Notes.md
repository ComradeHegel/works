# Notes

1. Quotes from the German Ideology, Volume 1, Chapter 1, Section A.
2. A Treatise on Revolution. Some of this I disagree with, and its very much summary and speculation. Working on a much more in-depth "A Second Treatise on Revolution" where I outline the revolution from the material conditions for it to arise all the way to communism.
3. Objects and Processes. Very much disagree; this work is Aristotelian idealism disguised with my pathetic attempt to reconcile it as materialism. The work is also unfinished.
4. Alternative forms of consciousness in revolution. Found in the same document as (2). Disagree.
5. To Feudalism. A slightly rushed exposition of historical materialism till fuedalism as outlined in The German Ideology.
6. A Second Treatise on Revolution. An in-depth outline of my thoughts on revolution, as well as certain concepts of Marxist theory. Sourced extensively.
7. A critique of the article Can Democracy and Communism Co-Exist. A critical analysis of comrade Galaxy's article on communism and democracy.
