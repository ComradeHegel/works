# Notes

1. Quotes from the German Ideology, Volume 1, Chapter 1, Section A.
2. A Treatise on Revolution. Some of this I disagree with, and its very much summary and speculation. Working on a much more in-depth "A Second Treatise on Revolution" where I outline the revolution from the material conditions for it to arise all the way to communism.
