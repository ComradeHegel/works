# Notes

1. Quotes from the German Ideology, Volume 1, Chapter 1, Section A.
2. A Treatise on Revolution. Some of this I disagree with, and its very much summary and speculation. Working on a much more in-depth "A Second Treatise on Revolution" where I outline the revolution from the material conditions for it to arise all the way to communism.
3. Objects and Processes. Very much disagree; this work is Aristotelean idealism disguised with my pathetic attempt to reconcile it as materialism. The work is alos unfinished.
4. Alternative forms of consciousness in revolution. Found in the same document as (2). Disagree.
