1. **Quotes from the German Ideology**  
Source: TGI - Quotes.pages  
Written: January 27, 2020 to February 12, 2020  
Note: These are from Volume 1, Chapter 1.
2. **The course of the revolution**  
Source: A Treatise on Revolution.pages  
Written: January 24, 2020 to March 1, 2020  
Some of this I disagree with, and it's very much summary and speculation. I have worked on a much more in-depth "On Revolution" where I outline the revolution from the material conditions for it to arise all the way to communism.
3. **Objects and Processes**  
Source: Objects and Processes.pages  
Written: November 6, 2019 to December 16, 2019  
Note: This work is Aristotelian idealism disguised with my pathetic attempt to reconcile it as materialism. The work is also unfinished.
4. **Alternative forms of consciousness in revolution**  
Source: A Treatise on Revolution.pages  
Written: January 24, 2020 to March 1, 2020  
Note: I found this work in the same document where I found "A Treatise on Revolution".
5. **To Feudalism**
