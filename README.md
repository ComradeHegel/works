# ComradeHegel/works
A combination of works I have written, not in the order they were written, and many of which I somewhat disagree with. For every complete and final draft of a work I write this is where I will upload it. I will also upload old works even if unfinished to catalogue my entire archive.

See the file `Notes.md`, I would say that (5)+ (5 onwards) represents the mature Marxist me.
