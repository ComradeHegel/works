# ComradeHegel/works
A combination of works I have written, not in the order they were written, and many of which I somewhat disagree with. For every complete and final draft of a work I write this is where I will upload it. I will also upload old works even if unfinished to catalogue my entire archive.

### Key Works
- [To Feudalism](https://github.com/ComradeSwifty/works/blob/master/files/To%20Feudalism.pdf)
- [A Second Treatise on Revolution](https://github.com/ComradeSwifty/works/blob/master/files/A%20Second%20Treatise%20on%20Revolution.pdf)
- [A critique of the article Can Democracy and Communism Co-Exist](https://github.com/ComradeSwifty/works/blob/master/files/A%20critique%20of%20the%20article%20Can%20Democracy%20and%20Communism%20Co-Exist.md)

See the file [Notes.md](https://github.com/ComradeSwifty/works/blob/master/Notes.md) for auxillary information on each work, I would say that (5)+ (5 onwards) represents the mature Marxist me.
